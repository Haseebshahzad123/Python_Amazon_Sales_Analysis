# Python_Amazon_Sales_Analysis
**Data Preparation:**<BR>
The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The Amazon sales data is loaded from a CSV file named "Amazon Sale Report.csv" using Pandas' read_csv() function.
The shape of the loaded DataFrame is checked, which indicates that it contains 128,976 rows and 21 columns.

Identifying and analyzing patterns or trends in the sales data
Developing predictive models to forecast future sales or identify high-potential products
Optimizing pricing, inventory, or marketing strategies based on the insights gained
Integrating the analysis with other data sources (e.g., customer demographics, competitor data) to derive more comprehensive insights
