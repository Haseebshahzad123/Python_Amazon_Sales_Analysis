# Python_Amazon_Sales_Analysis
Data Preparation:
The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The Amazon sales data is loaded from a CSV file named "Amazon Sale Report.csv" using Pandas' read_csv() function.
The shape of the loaded DataFrame is checked, which indicates that it contains 128,976 rows and 21 columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The code does not provide any explicit EDA steps, but the provided dataset suggests that the analysis could involve exploring various aspects of the sales data, such as:
Order status (e.g., Cancelled, Shipped, Delivered)
Fulfillment method (e.g., Merchant, Amazon)
Sales channel (e.g., Amazon.in)
Product categories and sizes
Courier status
Customer location (ship-city, ship-state, ship-postal-code, ship-country)
B2B (Business-to-Business) sales
Fulfilled by (e.g., Easy Ship)
New and Pending sales
Visualization and Reporting:
Based on the analysis, the project could involve creating various visualizations and reports to gain insights into the Amazon sales data, such as:
Sales trends over time
Top-selling product categories or sizes
Geographical sales distribution
Comparison of sales channels or fulfillment methods
Analysis of cancelled, shipped, and delivered orders
Insights into B2B sales and their characteristics
Potential Next Steps:
Depending on the specific goals of the analysis, the project could be extended to include:
Identifying and analyzing patterns or trends in the sales data
Developing predictive models to forecast future sales or identify high-potential products
Optimizing pricing, inventory, or marketing strategies based on the insights gained
Integrating the analysis with other data sources (e.g., customer demographics, competitor data) to derive more comprehensive insights
